Welcome to my Software Testing Projects repository! This repository contains various projects showcasing my skills and expertise in software testing, both manual and automated. Below is a list of the current projects included in this repository.

## Projects

### [Project-1: OpenCart](./Project-1%20(OpenCart)/)

**Description**: OpenCart is an e-commerce website that I have thoroughly tested using both manual and automation testing methods. This project includes detailed documentation of test scenarios, test cases, a requirements traceability matrix (RTM), and bug reports. The documentation is maintained in Excel files. For automation testing, I utilized Selenium with Java and TestNG for reporting. Additionally, I performed load and performance testing using JMeter.

**Key Features**:
- Manual Testing: Test scenarios, test cases, RTM, and bug reports.
- Automation Testing: Selenium with Java and TestNG.
- Performance Testing: JMeter.

### [Project-2: API Testing](./Project-2%20(API%20Testing)/)

**Description**: This project focuses on API testing using Postman and Newman. I have performed CRUD operations on a test API provided by Reqres.in and included assertions to verify the responses. The project contains a Postman collection, Newman reports, and screenshots.

**Key Features**:
